# microcDB
microcDB is a light weight NoSQL database for mostly resource limited embedded/IoT systems. The database can be stored in local flash memory or the external SD card or external memory(EEPROM,FLASH,etc). It can also act as a server in which a dedicated MCU will handle requests from Clients on UART,MODBUS,Ethernet,SPI,I2C,CAN or any wireless communication. microcDB also supports authentication,encryption or access levels for specific users. microcDB is supported on major IoT OSes and RTOS.  Currently its developed for STM32 but soon it will be developed for other MCUs too.
